 * capability failed under an evaluator contract that can attribute the
 * miss, and the stamped missingFunctions ⊆ the task's declared
 * requiredFunctions resolve to a declared support provider.
 *
 * Resolution state machine per (targetCapability, function) pair:
 *   issued    — the failure attributed the function
 *   consumed  — a later VERIFIED support_attempt on the provider cap
 *               whose task actually requires that function (success or
 *               fail — one probe cycle per demand; a probe cannot
 *               resolve evidence it never tested)
 *   cancelled — a later verified success on a TARGET task that itself
 *               requires the function: demonstrated recovery is the
 *               only evidence that retires a demand, and it also
 *               re-arms the pair's cycle budget (the episode closed).
 *               A success that never exercised the function proves
 *               nothing about it.
 *   re-issue  — bounded per unresolved episode by
 *               policy supportDemand.maxCyclesPerPair; the budget is
 *               lifetime-safe because demonstrated recovery resets it.
 *
 * Returns the full demand lifecycle — `pending` (still outstanding) and
 * `resolved` (consumed or cancelled) — in canonical issue order.
 * Everything is re-derived from events every call — replay is
 * deterministic and a foreign learner's log cannot satisfy a demand
 * (learnerId filter). The learner model reads the same derivation:
 * it never invents a second demand history. */
