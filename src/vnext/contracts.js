 *
 *   Capability = what the learner can do
 *   Mission    = real-world scenario combining capabilities
 *   Task       = one elicitation/learning unit

 *   Assessment = fresh sampling of ability

 * These validators exist so the contracts are *executable truth*, not
 * documentation — a task that violates its own purpose class, or a
 * mission whose teaching items leak into assessment, fails validation
 * before a single learner touches it.
