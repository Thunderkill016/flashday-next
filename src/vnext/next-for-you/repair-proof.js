/*
 * Mission-local repair reachability proof (Mission 008G) — ROUTING
 * TRUTH for correction episodes.
 *
 * deriveCorrectionEpisodes answers evidence truth only: which episodes
 * exist, which functions remain missing, which surfaces are burned.
 * Whether the learner still has a repair path INSIDE the serving mission
 * is a different question — one the old code answered by scanning the
 * full task registry, which could hold a remediation task belonging to
 * another mission (false positive) or name a task the live routes would
 * never actually serve (existence ≠ reachability).
 *
 * This module proves, per open episode, that repair is safe under the
 * CURRENT policy: every live repair route's actual next serve — the
 * natural pick, no exclusions, exactly what the policy would serve — is
 * either neutralised (its pick is a reserved probe, a filtered task, or
 * nothing) or a mission-local, validator-clean, repair-eligible,
 * non-probe task covering EVERY still-missing function, and at least
 * one route is actually usable. Per-function witness streams are kept
 * for audit only; a different-stream-member-per-function proof is NOT
 * accepted — the route can only serve one task next and serving it may
 * exhaust the repair bound (R1 review), and the policy is free to
 * prefer a partial-coverage route over the covering one (R2 review):
 *
 *   deriveCorrectionEpisodes()      — evidence truth
 *         ↓
 *   deriveMissionRepairPlan(s)()    — this file: ∀ live routes inert-or-
 *                                     covering, ≥1 actually usable
 *         ↓
 *   deriveRetestReservations()      — the withheld probe-id set
 *         ↓
 *   hardFilter(reservations)        — candidates on a reserved probe are
 *         ↓                          ineligible (except the retest kind)
 *   policyB1()
 *
 * Repair routes are exactly the ones the live policy mints: CORRECTION
 * and REFRESH. SUPPORT_DEMAND is never a repair witness (support success
 * does not repair a target episode), and no other intent is silently
 * promoted into one — extending the route set is a contract change.
 *
 * Reservation semantics by episode state:
 *   OPEN              — nothing reserved; the first covering success may
 *                       legitimately BE the repair on any surface.
 *   REPAIRING/RELAPSED— reserve the fresh probes IFF the proof is
 *                       complete for EVERY remaining function; otherwise
 *                       the probes stay servable (a probe may become the
 *                       repair rather than stranding the learner).
 *   REPAIRED_WAITING  — reserve directly; repair already demonstrated,
 *                       no channel proof owed.
 *   RETEST_DUE        — nothing reserved; the retest must serve.
 *   VERIFIED          — terminal; nothing reserved.
