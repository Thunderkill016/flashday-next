/*
 * vNext correction episodes (Mission 008F) — pure replay-derived state.
 *
 * The kernel today can show FAILED → REPAIR → "did it right after
 * correction". B0 treats that remediation success as permission to move
 * on to transfer/assessment. The evidence does not support that reading:
 * immediate post-correction performance is *working* knowledge, and only
 * a successful INDEPENDENT retest after a meaningful delay verifies the
 * correction (docs/research/next-for-you/14-correction-episodes.md).
 *
 * This module derives the episode lifecycle from the append-only event
 * log — never stored, always recomputed:
 *
 *   OPEN              authoritative attributed failure on a TAUGHT cap
 *   REPAIRING         a remediation-purpose attempt seen (any outcome)
 *   REPAIRED_WAITING  an independent success covering ≥1 missing function
 *                     (any non-support surface — a demonstrated recovery
 *                     is the repair, matching the demand lifecycle's rule)
 *   RETEST_DUE        REPAIRED_WAITING with now ≥ repairedAt + lag
 *   VERIFIED          every missing function independently demonstrated
 *                     post-lag on a retest-eligible surface — terminal
 *   RELAPSED          a new authoritative failure while waiting/due
 *                     → repair path returns; lag restarts at the new
 *                     repairedAt
 *
 * Hard boundaries (same bar the projection/learner-model enforce):
 *   - only VERIFIED events count — the task must resolve to a registered
 *     taskId@revision and pass verifyEventTask (stale revisions, forged
 *     bindings, wrong learners and modality mismatches are context,
 *     never episode evidence);
 *   - an episode opens ONLY on an observed fail/partial under an
 *     attributing contract (contractAttributesFunctions) with a
 *     non-empty missingFunctions ∩ requiredFunctions — a non-attributing
 *     miss is information, never a repairable episode (Mission 007);
 *   - episodes open only on capabilities that were TAUGHT before the
 *     failure (a prior verified success at any support level) — a
 *     baseline probe miss is information, not a broken ability;
 *   - supported/unobserved successes neither repair nor verify;
 *   - a retest surface must differ from EVERY failure surface recorded
 *     in the episode (the opening source task AND any retest that
 *     itself failed — reselling a failed item is not an independent
 *     retest) and from every remediation task consumed in the episode,
 *     and must declare the still-missing function it claims to retest;
 *   - the lag is the SAME named policy constant as retention
 *     (policy.retention.minLagMs) — B1 invents no second delay number;
 *   - VERIFIED is terminal — a later attributed failure opens a NEW
 *     episode; one open episode per capability at a time;
 *   - canonical order is (occurredAt, id): replay of the same event set
 *     is byte-identical regardless of delivery order or resyncs.
 *
 * Mission 008G boundary: this module is EVIDENCE TRUTH only — which
 * episodes exist, which functions remain missing, which surfaces are
 * burned, what state each episode is in. Whether the serving mission can
 * still repair an open episode (and therefore whether fresh retest
 * surfaces may be withheld) is ROUTING TRUTH, proven per-mission in
 * next-for-you/repair-proof.js — never inferred from the full task
 * registry here.
