/*
 * vNext capability-state projection (issue #42, capability-model-v0.md §2).
 *
 * States are DERIVED from the append-only event log, never stored:
 *
 *   NOT_SEEN → EXPOSED → SUPPORTED → INDEPENDENT → RETAINED → TRANSFERRED → FLUENT
 *
 * The milestone rules encode the spec's non-negotiables:
 *   - exposure is any modality-matched contact, including a failed probe;
 *   - SUPPORTED = a success that needed answer-bearing help or was not
 *     observed (self-report cannot prove independence);
 *   - INDEPENDENT = an observed, unaided success on an ATTEMPT event;
 *   - RETAINED = another unaided observed success ≥ RETENTION_DELAY_MS
 *     after the first independent success;
 *   - TRANSFERRED = an unaided observed success in a 'transfer' context
 *     whose promptFamily was never rehearsed — a family practiced WITH
 *     support is still rehearsed and cannot pass as novel;
 *   - FLUENT — RESERVED, unreachable in v0. The doctrine requires
 *     hesitation + intelligibility + successful turns + repairs +
 *     stability; no single field measures that yet and "responded
 *     faster" is not fluency. The milestone and state exist so the enum
 *     is stable, but nothing promotes into it until a dedicated
 *     fluency-evidence contract is calibrated.
 *
 * Hard boundaries:
 *   - only ATTEMPT_TYPES may advance state — an exposure/feedback/support
 *     record carrying an outcome field is context, not performance;
 *   - only events for THIS learner and THIS modality count — a speaking
 *     event can never mark a listening capability learned, and a mixed
 *     learner log can never cross-contaminate;
 *   - canonical order is (occurredAt, id) — arrival order can never
 *     change the projection; replay of the same event set is identical.
